## Ping-Of-Duty
Your network is a battlefield. Don't go in blind.

## Mission Debrief
In the fast-paced world of digital engagement, you can't afford to waste resources on downed hostiles. Wasted clicks are a liability. That's where Ping-Of-Duty comes in.

This lightweight, high-speed reconnaissance tool allows you, the Commander, to verify a target's operational status before committing to a full-scale connection using the standard ping command.

## Operations
* **DEPLOY PING:** Dispatches a single operative (ICMP packet) to the target coordinates (hostname or IP).

* **AWAIT INTEL:** Analyzes the return signal for critical data.

* **Echo Received:** Target confirmed! The hostile is live and operational. You are greenlit to engage.

* **Request Timed Out:** Our operative is MIA. The target is unresponsive and considered KIA (Killed in Action). Do not proceed.

## Features
* **Stealth Operations:** Leaves a minimal network footprint.

* **Rapid Deployment:** Get mission-critical status in milliseconds.

* **Zero Casualties:** No risk to your own system.

_Stop guessing. Start pinging. Oorah._
